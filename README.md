
### General info

This fork is a fork of V4 Trains, which is a fork from 2cc Trains In NML for OpenTTD. This set is focused on trains from Central Europe (mostly Visegrad group). With this number of forks it must be easy to eat spaghetti.

### This Fork's details
This adjustment has been made by fkally/zaiw in an effort to allow for a better flexibility in adjusting this GRF's difficulty. I found the infrastructure cost way too low compared to the vehicles, especially when playing with other GRF.

I strongly recommend to play this newGRF with the JGR Patch Pack, the "Polroad" newgrf, and the "Potrams" newgrf. For players who like to begin pre-1950, I would advise to use a 600mm gauge railroad newGRF. Also, Busy Bee Reward and FIRS play nicely with the increased difficulty of this pack.
